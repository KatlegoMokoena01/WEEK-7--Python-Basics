#variables must start a letter or an underscore, no numbers or symbols.
#Make sure your variables are all lower case
#Even though Python allows you to use any name for the variables, it is adviceable to name them based on the purpose of the variable
#If you want to name a variable with two words, you will use an underscore.

#Valid Variable names
my_variable = 10
total_count = 0
user = 'John'

#Invalid 
second_variable = 10
user_name = 20
